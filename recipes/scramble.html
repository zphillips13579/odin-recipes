    <h4>You will never get your eggs to look this good</h4>
    <p><strong>Scrambled eggs are the final test of anyone who would dare to call themselves a chef.</strong> 
        Deceptively simple, this dish will take everything you have to perfect. Frankly, I don't think you can do it. You'll
    just mess it up, probably. You should give up now.</p>
    <p>It takes professional chefs centuries to properly execute this recipe. Prepare to be broken.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Strength of Will</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place a slick, nonstick pan on the stove. Preheat the pan on medium heat. <em>Weep.</em></li>
        <li>Crack two eggs into a bowl. If you get shells in it, don't worry, you won't be a chef for long. 
            Add a splash of milk and beat the eggs.</li>
        <li>Coat the heated pan with butter or another oil.</li>
        <li>Take a deep breath.</li>
        <li>Plunge the beaten eggs into the pan and begin to stir it viciously. Show me what you got.</li>
        <li>Stir it faster. <em>Faster.</em> You are not stirring fast enough. <strong><em>Stir Faster.</em></strong></li>
        <li>Pour the eggs onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
    And you're done! Congratulations and enjoy your breakfast. You've earned it.
